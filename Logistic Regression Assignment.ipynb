    "Question 1: What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a supervised learning technique used to model the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable. It assumes that changes in the dependent variable can be explained by changes in the independent variable in a linear manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Simple Linear Regression is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variable and to understand how strongly and in what direction the independent variable affects the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The observations are independent of each other\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors have constant variance\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors are normally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes only one independent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3: Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and explain each term.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A simple linear regression model represents the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable using a straight-line relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variable is the output that the model aims to predict.\n",
    "The independent variable is the input used to make the prediction.\n",
    "The coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable.\n",
    "The intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4: Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be applied.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A real-world example of simple linear regression is predicting house prices based on the size of the house. In this case, house size is the independent variable and house price is the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 5: What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The method of least squares is a technique used to find the best-fitting line by minimizing the total squared difference between the actual values and the predicted values. This method ensures that the model has the smallest possible overall prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 6: What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification problems, especially when the output has two possible outcomes. It predicts the probability of an outcome belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression is used for predicting continuous numerical values, whereas Logistic Regression is used for predicting categorical outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 7: Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Three common evaluation metrics for regression models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error: Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error: Represents the square root of mean squared error and gives error in original units\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 8: What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The R-squared metric is used to measure how well the independent variable explains the variation in the dependent variable. A higher R-squared value indicates that the model explains a greater portion of the variability in the data."

    "Question 10: How do you interpret the coefficients in a simple linear regression model?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The coefficient represents how much the dependent variable changes when the independent variable increases by one unit. A positive coefficient indicates a positive relationship, while a negative coefficient indicates a negative relationship. The intercept shows the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero."
